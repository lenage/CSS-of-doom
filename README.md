## CSS of Doom ##
annoy your visitors with these few lines of CSS

Try it anywhere

    javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://raw.github.com/midday/CSS-of-doom/master/doom.js';})();

<del>Load it in your site</del>

<del><link id="css-of-doom" rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.github.com/midday/CSS-of-doom/master/doom.css" type="text/css"></del>

Looks like you can't host css on github because of mime types
